# Build-and-Implement-ML-pipeline-an-Object-Detector-for-FMCG
Object Detector to detect the products present on the shelf for FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods)

# **Overview**

FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) brands require insights into retail shelves to help them improve their sales. One such insight comes from determining how many products of their brandsâ€™ are present versus how many products of competing brands are present on a retail store shelf. This requires finding the total number of products present on every shelf in a retail store.
